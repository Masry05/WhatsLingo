    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: August 12, 2024</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy of WhatsApp Whisper. Your privacy is critically important to us, and this document outlines the types of personal information we collect and how we use, share, and protect that information.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Process</h2>
    <p>WhatsApp Whisper is designed with your privacy in mind. While we process your WhatsApp messages on our server to provide certain functionalities, we do not store any message data on our servers. Our service merely acts as a relay to perform the necessary encryption and decryption, ensuring that your data remains secure and private.</p>
    
    <h3>Local Storage and User Data</h3>
    <p>To enhance your experience, WhatsApp Whisper may use local storage on your device to save preferences such as passwords or encryption keys. This data is stored locally on your device, and we do not have access to it. Your information is completely under your control, and we do not share, sell, or access any of your locally stored data.</p>
    
    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We take your security seriously and employ industry-standard measures to ensure the safety of your data during transmission. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee absolute security, but we continually work to protect your information to the best of our ability.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Our extension may link to third-party services that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
